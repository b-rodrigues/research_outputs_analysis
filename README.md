# Research Publications Affiliated with Luxembourg: A Data-Driven Analysis

A reproducible analysis that:

1. Fetches and analyses metadata from the [OpenAlex API](https://openalex.org).
2. Performs bibliometric and statistical analysis using R. The analysis is executed in a reproducible environment defined with Nix.
3. The analysis is compiled through GitHub Actions and the report published on GitHub Pages.

---

## Usage

1. Reade the analysis [here]().

2. To reproduce locally, first install Nix. [Follow these instructions](https://docs.determinate.systems/).

3. Bootstrap the execution environment by installing R and `{rix}` in a temporary Nix shell:

   ```bash
   nix-shell -p R rPackages.rix
   ```

4. Start R, and source the `gen-env.R` script:

   ```r
   source("gen-env.R")
   ```

5. Leave R and the temporary shell, then build the enviroment:

   ```bash
   nix-build
   ```

6. Drop into the enviroment and source the `gen-pipeline.R` script:

   ```r
   source("gen-pipeline.R")
   ```

7. Check out the output by running:

   ```r
   rixpress::rxp_copy("report")
   ```

   You'll find the report in `pipeline-output/report.html`
